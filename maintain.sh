# uv-secure prints its verdict but can then crash in an internal teardown with a
# NON-ZERO exit -- observed as "annotated-doc raised exception" and later "anyio raised
# exception"; both are bugs in uv-secure's OWN uvx env, not a project vulnerability. With
# set -e that teardown crash aborts the whole gate before ruff/pyright/tests. So gate on
# the VERDICT, not the exit code: capture the output, accept the run when uv-secure
# reported all-safe (even if it then crashed), but still FAIL on a real finding (no
# all-safe line) so a genuine CVE is never masked, and fail loud if it never got a
# verdict at all (so a broken run is never silently skipped).
