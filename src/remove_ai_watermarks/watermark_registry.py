"""Registry of known visible watermarks.

A single catalog that ties each known visible mark to (a) where it usually sits,
(b) how to recognize it there, and (c) how to remove it. One pass over the
registry detects every known mark in its usual place and removes the ones
present.

**Localize -> fill.** A known mark is removed by LOCALIZING it (a template-free,
version-robust detector that returns a binary footprint MASK) and then handing
that mask to ONE shared, swappable fill backend (``region_eraser``: cv2 Telea/NS,
MI-GAN, or big-LaMa). No mark carries a reverse-alpha step any more: the old
``original = (wm - a*logo)/(1-a)`` recovery depended on a fixed captured alpha map
at a fixed position, broke whenever a vendor re-rendered or moved its mark, and was
not colour-lossless even with the right map (it amplifies quantization/JPEG-chroma
error by ``1/(1-a)`` -- the "the color just changed, not removed" reports). The
localizer stays cheap (cv2/numpy, CPU) so a memory-tight caller can run it on a
small worker; the heavy fill (MI-GAN / LaMa) is opt-in and chosen by the caller.

Entries:
  - ``gemini`` -- Google Gemini / Nano Banana sparkle, bottom-right.
  - ``doubao`` -- ByteDance Doubao "豆包AI生成" text strip, bottom-right.
  - ``jimeng`` -- ByteDance Jimeng / Dreamina "★ 即梦AI" wordmark, bottom-right.
  - ``samsung`` -- Samsung Galaxy AI "Contenuti generati dall'AI" strip, bottom-left.
  - ``jimeng_pill`` -- Jimeng-basic "AI生成" pill, top-left (capture-less).

    The three stages are separated: PERCEPTION (:func:`_build_candidates` -- engines
    report what they see, no policy), DECISION (:func:`decide` -- the pure arbiter over
    ``(candidates, Context)``), ACTION (localize -> :func:`fill` per winner). Marks
    coexist in different corners -- a Jimeng-basic image carries BOTH the top-left pill
    AND the bottom-right wordmark -- so every decided mark is removed, chained on the
    progressively-cleaned image (order does not matter, each re-localizes its corner).

    Three orthogonal knobs: ``sensitivity`` (how hard to trust a borderline mark --
    see :data:`Sensitivity`), ``provenance`` (vendor keys external metadata confirms,
    the evidence that drives ``auto``; the TC260 label maps to ``jimeng``/``doubao``),
    and ``backend`` (the shared fill). Returns ``(result, [labels removed])``; empty
    means nothing fired."""
