"""High-level convenience API: clean an image (or array) in one call.

The low-level building blocks live in ``watermark_registry`` (localize -> fill) and
``image_io`` (Unicode-safe, alpha-preserving IO). This module ties them into the two
calls a caller usually wants, so a library user does not have to decode images, wire
up metadata provenance, or preserve the alpha channel by hand:

    import remove_ai_watermarks as raiw
    raiw.remove_visible("in.png", "out.png")                 # path -> file, provenance auto
    result, removed = raiw.remove_visible(bgr_array)         # array -> array
    raiw.remove_visible("shot.png", "out.png", sensitivity="assume_ai")
    raiw.visible_provenance("in.png")                        # -> frozenset({"gemini"})

Imports stay lazy (inside the functions), so ``import remove_ai_watermarks`` is cheap.

    Samsung text, the Jimeng pill) via localize -> fill, returning ``(result_bgr,
    [labels removed])``.

    ``source`` is a file path OR a BGR ndarray. For a PATH, metadata provenance is read
    automatically (so ``sensitivity="auto"`` recovers a moved/faint mark whenever the
    file still carries its provenance) and the alpha channel is preserved on write; for
    an ARRAY there is no metadata to read and no separate alpha plane. When ``output``
    is given the cleaned image is written there (alpha rejoined for a path source); the
    array is always returned as well, so an empty ``removed`` list tells a caller nothing
    known was found (e.g. route to the diffusion ``all`` path or ``erase``).

    ``sensitivity`` (``auto``/``strict``/``assume_ai``) and ``backend``
    (``auto``/``cv2``/``migan``/``lama``) are the same knobs as the CLI. Pass
    ``sensitivity="assume_ai"`` for a metadata-stripped screenshot the caller knows is
    AI-generated (best recall, at the cost of a small near-lossless fill on a clean
    corner if the guess is wrong).

    ``strip_metadata`` (default True, matching the CLI ``visible --strip-metadata``)
    also strips AI provenance metadata (C2PA/EXIF/XMP/IPTC) from the written output via
    the lossless :func:`metadata.remove_ai_metadata`, so a library call does exactly
    what the CLI does. Only applies when ``output`` is given.

    ``write_noop`` (default True) controls whether ``output`` is written when NOTHING was
    removed: True writes a clean passthrough copy (an idempotent clean); False leaves the
    output path untouched, so a caller that treats "no mark" as "produce nothing" (the CLI
    ``visible`` no-mark contract) does not clobber a pre-existing file at that path.
